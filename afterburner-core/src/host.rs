//! Host function API surface exposed to JS scripts.
//!
//! This module declares the *shape* of every host function. The actual
//! WASM-side wiring (Wasmtime `Linker` registration, WASI glue) lives in
//! `afterburner-wasi`. Embedders implement `HostContext` to plug their own
//! data into `ReadColumn` / `EmitRow`.
//!
//! `Log` and `GetEnv` are the commonly-wired variants; the rest are
//! implemented by hosts that opt into richer integrations.
