//! The `Combustor` trait — where fuel (JS) meets air (data).
//!
//! Two implementations live in sibling crates: `WasmCombustor`
//! (`afterburner-wasi`) for untrusted code, `NativeCombustor`
//! (`afterburner-ignite`) for trusted code. `AdaptiveCombustor`
//! (`afterburner-adaptive`) composes both.
