//! T3 gate: imbalanced load (every job hashes to one worker) still
//! drains across N workers via steal-when-idle.
//!
//! We pin every thrust to the *same* `ScriptId` — so hash routing
//! deterministically targets a single worker — then submit a CPU-bound
//! batch and assert the wall-clock falls well below "single-threaded
//! sum of execution times." Since `worker_id` victim selection in
//! `worker_loop` cycles through peers, all idle workers should pick up
//! some of the load.
//!
//! Container-friendliness mirrors `thrust_scale.rs`: skip cleanly when
//! `available_parallelism() < 2`.
