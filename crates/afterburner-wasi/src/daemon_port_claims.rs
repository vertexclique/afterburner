//! Shared port-claim registry for multi-shard daemon coordinators.
//!
//! `DaemonNet` / `DaemonTls` / `DaemonDgram` each live per-shard in
//! `HostState`. When a daemon-init source calls
//! `net.createServer().listen(3000)`, every shard's coordinator
//! tries to bind port 3000 — without arbitration, only one shard
//! wins and the others fail with EADDRINUSE, killing daemon-init.
//!
//! `SharedPortClaims` is a process-shared, lock-free port arbiter
//! built on `kovan_map::HopscotchMap::get_or_insert` (CAS-based).
//! All shard-local coordinators consult it before binding:
//!
//! * The first shard to call `try_claim(port)` becomes the
//!   **owner** and proceeds with the real `bind(2)` + listener task.
//! * Subsequent shards become **followers** — they get the same
//!   id back and treat their `listen()` as a no-op (no bind, no
//!   listener task spawned). The user's JS sees a live listener,
//!   the kernel sees only one bound socket.
//!
//! ## Connection-load semantics
//!
//! Unlike HTTP (where the central event channel fans accepts out
//! to every shard via the pool's RR dispatcher), raw TCP / TLS /
//! UDP listeners feed connections only to the **owner** shard's
//! event queue. The follower shards' `server.on('connection')`
//! / `socket.on('message')` handlers never fire for that port.
//!
//! Concretely: a multi-shard daemon serving HTTP gets N-way
//! parallelism; the same daemon serving raw TCP gets 1-way
//! (only the binding shard's CPU is used for that listener).
//! For workloads that need N-way TCP throughput, front the
//! service with HTTP, or run with `BURN_SHARDS=1` for explicit
//! single-shard semantics.
//!
//! This trade-off is acceptable because the alternative —
//! cross-shard FD passing or SO_REUSEPORT — adds significant
//! complexity (the kernel hashes connections across listeners
//! by 4-tuple, which doesn't load-balance evenly under bursty
//! traffic; FD passing introduces ordering races between accept
//! and dispatch). Listener compatibility (no init crash) is the
//! security-relevant property; throughput parallelism for raw
//! sockets is a separate phase.
