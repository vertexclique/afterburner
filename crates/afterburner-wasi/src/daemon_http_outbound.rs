//! Outbound HTTP — async, per-shard. Mirrors Node's libuv-driven
//! request flow.
//!
//! When JS calls `http.request(opts, cb)` (or `https.request`,
//! `fetch`, anything that ends up at our `__host_http_request_async`
//! host import), the wasm side allocates a `req_id` and spawns the
//! request through this coordinator. The Tokio task polls the
//! upstream server, builds a response, and pushes a
//! `HttpOutboundResponseEvent` onto the per-shard channel. The
//! shard's event loop drains the channel each tick and dispatches
//! back into JS as a `daemon-event` of kind `http-response`, which
//! resolves the matching Promise stashed in
//! `globalThis.__ab_http_pending[req_id]`.
//!
//! That's the architecture Node-shaped libraries (npm's
//! `make-fetch-happen` / `minipass-fetch`, undici, node-fetch, the
//! pacote stack) need to actually progress: the JS-side `await
//! fetch(url)` returns a Promise that *only* resolves when real
//! async work completes — not the synchronous "wait for the entire
//! body, then deliver" shape that fakes async via microtasks.
//!
//! ## Lock-free
//!
//! `kovan_channel` for the response queue, `AtomicI64` for the
//! request-id allocator, `HopscotchMap` for the in-flight count.
//! No mutexes.
//!
//! ## Per-shard
//!
//! Each daemon shard owns its own `DaemonHttpOutbound`. Responses
//! are delivered to the shard that issued the request — JS-side
//! Promise state is per-shard (each shard runs its own QuickJS),
//! so cross-shard delivery would land in a Store with no matching
//! pending entry.
//!
//! ## Manifold
//!
//! Outbound HTTP requires `NetAccess::OutboundHttp` or
//! `NetAccess::OutboundFull`, identical to the sync `http_host`
//! path. Permission denied surfaces as a synthetic 0-status response
//! with an `__HOST_ERR__:` body so the JS shim can convert into a
//! typed Error without changing the response shape.
